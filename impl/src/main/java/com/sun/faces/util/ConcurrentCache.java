/**
 * Defines a concurrent cache with a factory for creating new object instances.
 * <br>
 * This (combined with ExpiringConcurrentCache) offers functionality similar to com.sun.faces.util.Cache. Two
 * differences:
 * <br>
 * 1. Cache is concrete/assumes a particular implementation. ConcurrentCache is abstract/allows subclasses to provide
 * the implementation. This facilitates alternative implementations, such as DefaultFaceletCache's NoCache. 2.
 * ConcurrentCache does not provide remove() as part of its contract, since remove behavior may be subclass-specific.
 * For example, ExpiringConcurrentCache automatically removes items by checking for expiration rather than requiring
 * manual removes.
 * <br>
 * We should consider consolidating Cache and ConcurrentCache + ExpiringConcurrentCache into a single class hierarchy so
 * that we do not need to duplicate the JCIP scalable result cache code.
