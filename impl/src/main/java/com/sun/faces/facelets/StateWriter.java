/**
 * A class for handling state insertion. Content is written directly to "out" until an attempt to write state; at that
 * point, it's redirected into a buffer that can be picked through in theory, this buffer should be very small, since it
 * only needs to be enough to contain all the content after the close of the first (and, hopefully, only) form.
 * <p>
 * Potential optimizations:
 * <ul>
 * <li>If we created a new FastWriter at each call to writingState(), and stored a List of them, then we'd know that
 * state tokens could only possibly be near the start of each buffer (and might not be there at all). (There might be a
 * close-element before the state token). Then, we'd only need to check the start of the buffer for the state token; if
 * it's there, write out the real state, then blast the rest of the buffer out. This wouldn't even require toString(),
 * which for large buffers is expensive. However, this optimization is only going to be especially meaningful for the
 * multi-form case.</li>
 * <li>More of a FastWriter optimization than a StateWriter, but: it is far faster to create a set of small 1K buffers
 * than constantly reallocating one big buffer.</li>
 * </ul>
